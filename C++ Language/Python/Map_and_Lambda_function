#MAP
#The map() function calls the specified function for each item of an iterable (such as string, list, tuple or dictionary) and returns a list of results.
def addition(n):
  return n+n
numbers=(1,2,3,4,5)
result=map(addition,numbers)
print (list(result))

#OUTPUT
#[2,4,6,8,10]

#LAMBDA
#Lambda functions are used when you need a function for a short period of time. This is commonly used when you want to pass a function as an argument to higher-order functions, that is, functions that take other functions as their arguments.

numbers=(1,2,3,4,5)
result=map(lambda x:x+x,numbers)
print(list(result))

#OUTPUT
#[2,4,6,8,10]
